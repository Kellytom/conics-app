This document is primarily focused on Windows operating systems, as many solutions involve tools and commands commonly used on Windows. While some commands are cross-platform, Linux and macOS are not covered in detail here. For Windows users, commands can be executed in PowerShell or Command Prompt, with PowerShell being the recommended shell due to its advanced features and integration with Windows systems.

**Note**: Linux and macOS are not covered in this document. If using those operating systems, adapt commands accordingly.

##### Local Software for Viewing Files

To view and edit markdown and HTML files on Windows, we recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). VS Code is a free, open-source code editor widely used by developers, supporting markdown rendering, HTML editing, syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and Git integration. It can be installed per-user without admin rights, making it suitable for restricted corporate environments. Extensions like markdown linting and HTML formatting enhance functionality.

For viewing HTML files, any web browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox) pre-installed on Windows systems can be used. For editing, VS Code is preferred for its developer-friendly features.

#### Additional Plan of Action from Key Points

##### A. Tests

- **Test Path Creation**: Verify user-writable directories (`mkdir ~/npm-global`).  
- **Test npm Install**: Confirm package installation (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Tools\node\npm install -g typescript`).  
- **Test Node Install**: Validate Node.js (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Tools\node\node.exe --version`).  
- **Test SSH**: Attempt SSH connection, fallback to HTTPS (`C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Tools\git\bin\ssh.exe -T git@github.com`).  
- **Test Replit AI**: Create and deploy an Astro project.  
- **GitHub: Failed VSCode Connection**: Log connection errors.  
- **Windsurf: Failed Login**: Document login issues.

##### B. Priority Solutions (1-7) from Key Points

1. **Cloud-Based Development Environments**: Use Replit AI or GitHub Codespaces for zero-install, AI-powered coding.  
2. **Containerization**: Use Docker for isolated environments.  
3. **CDN-Based Solutions**: Quick prototyping with Preact or TypeScript via CDNs.  
4. **Portable Versions of Tools**: Offline solution with full-path execution.  
5. **Package Managers with User-Level Installations**: Reliable but slower setup.  
6. **Vanilla JavaScript Solutions**: Dependency-free but limited scope.  
7. **Workarounds for Corporate Firewalls**: Enable other solutions with IT support.
